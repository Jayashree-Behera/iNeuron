    "### 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "The re. compile() function returns Regex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The search() method searches a string for a specified value, and returns the position of the match. The search value can be string or a regular expression. This method returns -1 if no match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the regex module first. Then  create a Regex object with the re.compile() function. Pass raw string you want to search into the Regex object’s search() method. This returns a Match object.Call the Match object’s group() method to return a string of the actual matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The | character signifies matching \"either, or\" between two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. In regular expressions, what does ? character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "? stands for match zero or one of the groups preceding this question mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "The + matches one or more. The * matches zero or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "{m} specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match. So a{4} will match exactly 4 'a' characters, but not 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "{m,n} causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible. So, a{4,5} will match from 4 to 5 'a' characters. Omitting m specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting n specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example, a{4,}b will match 'aaaab' or a thousand 'a' characters followed by a 'b', but not 'aaab'. The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with the previously described form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\\d (digit) matches any decimal digit character(same as [0-9] ). \n",
    "\\w matches any alphanumeric word character. Word characters are uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the underscore (_) character, so \\w is essentially shorthand for [a-zA-Z0-9_].\n",
    "\\s matches any whitespace character:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\\D is the opposite of \\d. It matches any character that isn’t a decimal digit. \\D is equivalent to [^0-9].\n",
    "\\W is the opposite of \\w. It matches any non-word character and is equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\\S is the opposite of \\s. It matches any character that isn’t whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "\n",
    ".*? is a non-greedy method that will try to match the shortest possible pattern or string.\n",
    "\n",
    ".* is a greedy method that will try to match as many pattern or string resulting in a longest possible pattern or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",

    "\n",
    "### 19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string .\n",

    "'6,368,745'\n",
