    "\n",
    "ans : shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil. copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it. Calling shutil. copytree( source, destination ) will copy the folder at the path source , along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination .\n",

    "### 2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: The os. rename() method allows you to rename files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : The delete functions in shutil modules deleting the files permanently. While the delete functions in the send2trash module allows you to move files to the recycle bin or trash rather than permanently deleting them.\n",
    "4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : To create your own compressed ZIP files, you must open the ZipFile object in write mode by passing 'w' as the second argument. (This is similar to opening a text file in write mode by passing 'w' to the open() function.)\n",
