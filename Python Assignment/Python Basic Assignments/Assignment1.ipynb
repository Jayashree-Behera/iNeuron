    "## 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "'*' Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'hello' Value\n",
    "\n",
    "'-87.8' Value\n",
    "\n",
    "'-' Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'/' Expression\n",

    "'•' Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "'6' Value\n",

    "## 2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable is storage place or memory location for any date type. String is data type that can be assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer - numerical values without decimal points that can be operated mathematically.\n",
    "Char -  integers, alphabets, symbols , space that cannot  be operated mathematically.\n",
    "String - set of characters that is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is a sequence of operands and operators. They are representations of values. Example - In “a+b=c”,  “a+b” is an expression that yields the result c , where a,b, c are values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression evaluates to a value. A statement does something such as representing an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statements. The above example “spam=10” is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: bacon = 22 because bacon+1 won't update the value in bacon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'  -   ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "'spam' * 3  -  ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable name needs to be a combination of letters, symbols and numbers and should not begin with a number. So eggs is a valid variable name and so is eggs100 or _100  but 100 and 100eggs are not valid variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "int() for integer\n",
    "\n",
    "float() for floating point\n",
    "\n",
    "string() for string\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it? 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : The datatypes in this expression are different. 99 is an integer while rest are strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correction : \n",
    "\n",
    "              'I have eaten ' + ‘99’ + ' burritos.'\n",

    "                           or\n",

    "             'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'\n"
